## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Service won't start**
   - Check Docker daemon running
   - Verify port availability
   - Review container logs
   - Check environment variables

2. **Dashboard not loading**
   - Verify port 8050/8051 accessible
   - Check firewall settings
   - Review Dash application logs
   - Test with localhost first

3. **Data generation fails**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify write permissions
   - Review configuration settings
   - Check dependency versions

4. **Performance issues**
   - Monitor CPU/memory usage
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Review data processing efficiency
   - Consider scaling options
