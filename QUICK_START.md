# ✅ Answer: How to Run Your Smart Grid Analytics System

## 🚀 Quick Answer

Your Smart Grid Analytics System is **ready to run**! Here's how:

### Fastest Way (Complete Setup):
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run everything at once
python main.py full
```

This will:
1. ✅ Train AI models (~20-30 minutes)
2. ✅ Launch web dashboard at http://localhost:8501
3. ✅ Start continuous monitoring

## 📋 All Available Commands

| Command | Purpose | Duration |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `python main.py full` | Complete setup (recommended) | ~30 minutes |
| `python main.py train` | Train AI models only | ~20-30 minutes |
| `python main.py dashboard` | Launch web interface | Instant |
| `python main.py deploy` | Generate predictions once | ~2-3 minutes |
| `python main.py continuous` | Run every 15 minutes | Continuous |
| `python main.py backtest` | Performance analysis | ~5 minutes |
| `python test_suite.py smoke` | Quick system test | ~30 seconds |

## 🎯 What You Get

- **📊 Real-time Dashboard:** Interactive visualizations at http://localhost:8501
- **🤖 AI Predictions:** Energy demand forecasts for 8 grid regions
- **🚨 Anomaly Detection:** Automatic alerts for unusual patterns
- **📈 Performance Metrics:** Model accuracy and system health monitoring
- **⚙️ Threshold Controls:** Adjust sensitivity via dashboard or CLI

## 📁 System Requirements Met ✅

- ✅ Python 3.12.3 (compatible)
- ✅ All dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ GPU detection works (falls back to CPU automatically)
- ✅ All smoke tests passing
- ✅ CLI interface fully functional
- ✅ Docker support available
- ✅ Windows batch scripts available

## 🔧 Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-time user
```bash
python main.py full
# Wait 30 minutes, then access http://localhost:8501
```

### Scenario 2: Just want predictions
```bash
python main.py train        # One-time setup
python main.py deploy       # Get forecasts
# Results in outputs/latest_predictions.json
```

### Scenario 3: Development/testing
```bash
python test_suite.py smoke  # Verify system
python main.py train        # Train models
python main.py backtest     # Analyze performance
```

### Scenario 4: Production monitoring
```bash
python main.py continuous   # Runs every 15 minutes
# Or use Docker: docker-compose up smart-grid
```
